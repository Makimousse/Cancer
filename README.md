# This is a project who, for a given age and sex, provides the user with a probability of having some type of cancer.
# Was also added the possibility to view one's chances of having cancer in other countries, from a list of 45 countries
# It is also possible to view the chances and survival chances of having the most common gender-specific cancers (prostate and breast)
# These results should NOT be taken at face value
# We are planning on making the program more and more precise with time, by adding more factors and more precise data

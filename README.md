# This is a project who, for a given age and sex, provides the user with a probability of having some type of cancer.
# It is also possible to view one's chances of having cancer in other countries, from a list of 45 countries.
# It is also possible to view the survival chances of having the most common gender-specific cancers (prostate and breast) over a period of 5 years
# These results should NOT be taken at face value.
# We are planning on making the program more and more precise with time, by adding more factors and more precise data.
# We are currently working on letting users input an interval of ages rather than a single age. The user would then get the average cancer rates for that interval.
# We recently added a system to filter invalid inputs. The code now proposes to the user to restart the program instead of simply generating an error.
